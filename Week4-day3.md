Kubernetes Concepts
Minikube: A Local Kubernetes Cluster
Minikube is a Kubernetes cluster that runs locally. It includes both master node and worker node processes within a single node. A full Kubernetes cluster usually has separate master and worker nodes, which require more resources. Minikube allows developers to run Kubernetes locally with minimal resource requirements.

Master Node and Worker Node
Master Node:
Manages the entire Kubernetes cluster.
Decides which worker node runs which pod.
Does not handle application requests directly.
Worker Node:
Runs applications inside pods.
Handles traffic and processes application requests.
NodePort and Localhost
NodePort:
Opens a port on every worker node, allowing external access.
Routes requests to the appropriate pod.
Runs on worker nodes.
Localhost:
Refers to the master components inside a master node.
Refers to a single worker node inside a worker.
Cannot be used to access pods from outside the cluster.
Replicas in Kubernetes vs. AWS Instances
Replicas in Kubernetes are similar to AWS instances but function within a Kubernetes cluster instead of cloud provider infrastructure.

Kubernetes Replicas:
Defined in the replicas field of a Deployment.
Ensures multiple identical Pod instances are running.
Used for containerized applications.
AWS Instances:
Standalone virtual machines (VMs).
Managed by Auto Scaling Groups.
Provide full operating system environments.
Mapping Kubernetes Concepts to AWS
Kubernetes	AWS Equivalent
Pod	One EC2 instance running an app
Replica	Auto Scaling Group with multiple instances
Cluster	Infrastructure distributing traffic across multiple pods
Load Balancer	AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)

📝 Notes:
emptyDir volumes are used for temporary storage within a pod's lifecycle.
For production, PersistentVolumes (PV) should be used with cloud storage integration.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
1. Classes and Objects
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class with its own attributes and methods.

Example:
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

fido = Dog("Fido", 3)
print(fido.bark())  # Output: Fido says Woof!
Explanation:
Dog is a class with attributes (name, age, species) and methods (bark).
self represents the instance being created.
fido = Dog("Fido", 3) creates an instance of the Dog class.
2. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

Example:
class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

class Cat(Pet):  # Cat inherits from Pet
    def __init__(self, name, age, color):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.color = color

whiskers = Cat("Whiskers", 4, "gray")
print(whiskers.name, whiskers.color)  # Output: Whiskers gray
Explanation:
Cat class inherits from Pet, reusing its properties.
super().__init__(name, age) calls the parent class constructor.
3. Encapsulation
Encapsulation restricts direct access to an object's data and requires interaction via methods.

Example:
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount
    
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = BankAccount("Alice", 1000)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1000
Explanation:
__balance is a private attribute.
Methods deposit() and get_balance() provide controlled access.
4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows different classes to have the same method name but different implementations.

Example:
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow"

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Bark
print(cat.speak())  # Output: Meow
Explanation:
The speak() method is defined in the Animal class but implemented differently in Dog and Cat.
5. Abstraction
Abstraction hides implementation details and only exposes essential features.

Example:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.area())  # Output: 78.5
Explanation:
Shape is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated.
Circle implements area(), making it a concrete class.
6. Method Overriding
A subclass can provide its own version of a method inherited from a parent class.

Example:
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        print("Parent method")

class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        print("Child method")

child = Child()
child.show()  # Output: Child method
Explanation:
The Child class overrides show() with its own implementation.
7. Operator Overloading
Python allows custom behavior for operators like +, -, *, etc.

Example:
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

v1 = Vector(2, 3)
v2 = Vector(4, 5)
result = v1 + v2  # Calls __add__
print(result.x, result.y)  # Output: 6 8
Explanation:
__add__ allows v1 + v2 to add two vectors element-wise.
8. Metaclasses
A metaclass defines how a class behaves, similar to how a class defines object behavior.

Example:
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()
print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
Explanation:
Ensures only one instance of a class is created (Singleton pattern).
